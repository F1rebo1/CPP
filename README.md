## Build and Compile Instructions

The quick build command is `Ctrl+Shift+B` --> following this select "C/C++ g++.exe build active file"
Build a file from terminal/cmdline: `g++ -o <Desired file name> sourceFileName.cpp`

When linking together multiple different files, simply include them one after the other like so: `g++ -o <Desired file name> source1.cpp source2.cpp`
